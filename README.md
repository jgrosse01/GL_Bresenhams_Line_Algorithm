# GL_Bresenhams_Line_Algorithm

A small program written in C++ using Open GL and FreeGLUT to implement Bresenham's Line Algorithm for the first octant of the cartesian plane.

The goal of this assignment is to understand and reproduce a functionally well optimized method for drawing lines before being permitted to use the line algorithm included in OpenGL.
